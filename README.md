# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
#### What Data do we have?
  The information that was provided was from an individual who wanted to run a kickstarter campaign. However, the individual needed to ensure that they would be able to accomplish thier fundraising goal within a short amount of time. This is why we must run various analysis to provide information on trends that we obtain from the data. This way the individual may be able to make a descision on how and when to start their kickstarter fundraiser.
#### What we have available?
  We have Data that show previous kickstarter data. This file displays the name of the kickstarter, Goal, amount Pledged,country,Category, Subcategory, and kickstarted launch/end date.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

We wanted to run various analysis that would help with coming to a decsion. We first looked at the outcomes of the kickstarters based on the Launch Date. Here we were able to create a pivot table, that showed the launch dates with the corresponding counts of the outcomes for each Kickstarter that were successful,failed, canceled. We then filtered by "theater" within the "Partent Category".

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

We then ran another analysis where we used the "COUNTIFS" to count the amount of Successful, Failed, and Canceled, plays that had goals within certain ranges. Then we calculated the Percentage of Successful, Failed, and Canceled kickstarters.

I noticed that the most Successful theater kickstarters were for the month of May. However, after that point the successful kickstarters have decreased.
There is a downward trend for the successful outcomes kickstarter.
There are no significant increases or decreases as time progress for the failed Kickstarters.

I see that as the goals increase the less likely the Kickstarter would be successful.
